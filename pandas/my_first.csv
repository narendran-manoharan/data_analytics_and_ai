2. Given the following list of numbers:

[1, 10, 40, 23, 19, 42, 12, 18, 17, 21, 8, 2]

Write a function which takes a number as a parameter, and checks if the
list contains two numbers which add up to that number. If there are, return the two numbers.
If not, return None. For example:



check_list(54)
-> returns [42, 12]

check_list(31)
-> returns [10, 21]

check_list(1000)
-> returns None
